# Skill Creator

Create effective Agent Skills using progressive disclosure.

## When to Create a Skill

Create a skill when you notice:

- **Repeating context** across conversations
- **Domain expertise** needed repeatedly
- **Project-specific knowledge** the agent should know automatically

## Progressive Disclosure

Skills load in 3 levels:

1. **Metadata** (~27 tokens optimal, ~100 max) - YAML frontmatter for triggering
2. **Instructions** (<50 lines recommended, 500 max) - SKILL.md body with core patterns
3. **Resources** (unlimited) - references/ scripts/ assets/ loaded on demand

**Key**: Keep Levels 1 & 2 lean. Move details to Level 3. Use `npx claude-skills-cli validate` to check budgets.

## Structure

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md       # Core instructions + metadata
├── references/    # Detailed docs (loaded as needed)
├── scripts/       # Executable operations
└── assets/        # Templates, images, files
```
