# Development Process

Step-by-step workflow for creating effective Agent Skills.

## The Eight Steps

### 0. Evaluate First

> "Create evaluations BEFORE writing extensive documentation."

Define 2-3 concrete use cases and success criteria before writing anything:

- What specific tasks should the skill enable?
- What does success look like? (triggers correctly, completes workflow, 0 errors)
- What does failure look like? (doesn't trigger, wrong output, user corrections needed)

This ensures the skill solves real problems rather than documenting imagined ones.

### 1. Recognize

Notice when you're repeatedly providing the same context or domain knowledge:

- Explaining the same database schema multiple times
- Providing API integration details in every conversation
- Sharing framework-specific conventions repeatedly
- Teaching the same domain concepts

**Signal**: "I've explained this 3+ times in different conversations"

### 2. Gather

Collect 3-5 concrete examples of how you've used this knowledge:

- Save conversation snippets showing the repeated context
- Document the specific questions or tasks that triggered the need
- Note the exact information you provided each time
- Identify common patterns across usage

**Output**: A collection of real usage examples

### 3. Plan

Decide information hierarchy:

**SKILL.md (Level 2)** - Core patterns only:

- What the skill does
- When to use it
- Essential structure/commands
- Links to references

**references/ (Level 3)** - Detailed docs:

- Complete API documentation
- Detailed examples and tutorials
- Background and theory
- Edge cases and troubleshooting

**scripts/ (Level 3)** - Deterministic operations:

- Validation logic
- Code generation
- File transformations
- Data processing

**assets/ (Level 3)** - Static resources:

- Templates
- Configuration files
- Images and diagrams

### 4. Structure

Create the directory structure:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills/my-skill/{references,scripts,assets}
touch .claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
```

### 5. Write

#### Write Description First

The description is critical for skill discovery. Format:

```
[Domain/Context] [operations/capabilities]. Use when [trigger scenarios].
```

Examples:

- "PostgreSQL schema and query patterns. Use when designing databases, writing queries, or optimizing performance."
- "Next.js 14 App Router conventions. Use when building Next.js apps, configuring routes, or implementing server components."
- "A skill for databases" (too vague)
- "This skill helps you work with PostgreSQL databases" (second person)

Target: 100-300 chars, max 1024 chars.

**Naming**: Use gerund form (`processing-pdfs`, `managing-databases`). Kebab-case only. Cannot contain "anthropic" or "claude".

#### Write SKILL.md Body

Structure:

1. **Brief intro** (1-2 lines) - What this skill provides
2. **When to use** (3-5 bullets) - Triggering scenarios
3. **Core patterns** (3-5 sections) - Essential knowledge
4. **Links to references** - Point to detailed docs

Guidelines:

- Use imperative voice ("Use X for Y", not "You should use X")
- Write descriptions in third person
- Provide concrete examples, not abstract concepts
- Keep it scannable with clear headings
- Target <50 lines (strict) or <500 lines (Anthropic max)
- Link liberally to references/

#### Write References

No size limits - be as detailed as needed:

- Use descriptive filenames (api-endpoints.md, not reference.md)
- Structure with clear headings
- Include code examples
- Cover edge cases
- Provide context and rationale
- For files over 100 lines, include a table of contents at top
- Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md (avoid nesting)
- Do NOT include README.md in the skill folder

### 6. Enhance

Add progressive enhancements:

**Scripts** - When operations are:

- Deterministic (same input = same output)
- Complex (would require the agent to generate code)
- Reusable (used frequently)

Examples: validators, code generators, formatters

**Assets** - When you need:

- Templates (boilerplate code, config files)
- Static files (images, data files)
- Resources that shouldn't be loaded into context

### 7. Iterate

Test and refine:

**Testing**:

- Start a new conversation
- Trigger the skill naturally (don't force it)
- Observe if the agent loads it appropriately
- Check if the content is helpful and sufficient

**Refining**:

- If skill loads too often → Make description more specific
- If skill never loads → Add trigger keywords to description
- If the agent asks for info that's in references → Add links in SKILL.md
- If SKILL.md feels bloated → Move content to references
- If you're repeating the same complex operation → Create a script

**Iteration Cycle**:

1. Use skill in real conversations
2. Note friction points and gaps
3. Refactor structure and content
4. Test again

## Common Pitfalls

**Starting Too Big**

- Writing 500 lines before testing
- Start with 30-line SKILL.md, iterate

**Generic Descriptions**

- "Helps with coding tasks"
- "React hooks patterns and performance optimization. Use when building React components or debugging re-renders."

**Bloated SKILL.md**

- Including complete API docs in SKILL.md
- Core patterns in SKILL.md, full docs in references/

**Missing Triggers**

- Description with no "Use when..." clause
- Clear triggering scenarios in description

**Second Person Voice**

- "You should use this pattern when you need..."
- "Use this pattern when..."

## Success Criteria

A well-designed skill:

- Loads automatically when relevant (no manual triggering)
- Provides exactly the context needed (not too much, not too little)
- Improves with each conversation (you notice missing pieces)
- Saves you time (no more re-explaining the same concepts)

## Testing Checklist

Before considering a skill complete, run through these checks:

### Structural

- [ ] `npx claude-skills-cli validate --strict` passes
- [ ] All reference links resolve to existing files
- [ ] Scripts have correct permissions and shebang lines
- [ ] No TODO placeholders remain

### Behavioral

- [ ] Skill triggers from natural language (don't name the skill directly)
- [ ] Skill does NOT trigger for unrelated requests
- [ ] Agent follows instructions from SKILL.md
- [ ] Agent reads reference files when needed
- [ ] Scripts produce expected output

### Content Quality

- [ ] Description in third person with keywords and "Use when..." trigger
- [ ] Name is kebab-case, no reserved words, no XML tags
- [ ] Imperative voice throughout
- [ ] Real examples, not generic placeholders
- [ ] SKILL.md body under 50 lines (strict) or 500 lines (loose)
- [ ] No README.md in skill folder
- [ ] References one level deep, long refs have TOC

## Tips

- **Start minimal**: Better to add than to remove
- **Test early**: Don't perfect in isolation
- **Use real examples**: Concrete beats abstract
- **Trust progressive disclosure**: the agent will ask for references when needed
- **Iterate based on usage**: Let real conversations drive refinement
